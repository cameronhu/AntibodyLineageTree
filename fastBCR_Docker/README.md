# fastBCR Docker Container Dev

This Dockerfile builds a container on top of the `rocker/r-base:latest`, installing all necessary R dependencies to run fastBCR. Also installs a Python version so a Python script can execute the fastBCR pipeline script.

## Nov 22 Testing

Local version fastBCR is properly installed, Python working!
